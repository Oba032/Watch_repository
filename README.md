## This is a repository for the exam in the course "HEL-8048-1 25V Advanced data analysis and visualization using programming"
    I intend to investigate what health parameters influence the amount of calories burnt throughout the day, as well as how sleep affects calorie expenditure.

 ## For this project you will need the following:
      1. An Apple Watch (Preferably a newer model such as the ULTRA S2)
      2. An Iphone with an active Apple-user (For extraction of data)
        These products have to be calibrated, connected, and enabled.
        Over the course of a given time of your choosing these projects will gather the types of data you want to assess.
    
  ## In this project i have chosen the following variables in my Apple watch:
    - Active Energy (kcal)
    - Apple Stand Hour (hours)
    - Heart Rate [Min] (bpm)
    - Heart Rate [Max] (bpm)
    - Heart Rate [Avg] (bpm)
    - Resting Energy (kJ)
    - Resting Heart Rate (bpm)
    - Sleep Analysis [Asleep] (hr)
    - Sleep Analysis [In Bed] (hr)
    - Sleep Analysis [Core] (hr)
    - Sleep Analysis [Deep] (hr)
    - Sleep Analysis [REM] (hr)
    - Sleep Analysis [Awake] (hr)
    - Step Count (steps)
    - Walking Heart Rate Average (bpm)


## For this to work you additionally need access to a 3rd party app for the extraction of health data:
       1.   In the app store of your Iphone, search for "Health Auto Export" or visit this link "https://apps.apple.com/us/app/health-auto-export-json-csv/id1115567069"
       2.   Find the app called "Health Auto Export - JSON+CSV" developed by Lybron Sobers and download it.
